# Assembly Language
Assembly is the low level language used with devices CPU or processor programming, specifically INTEL, ADM and others. It's the instruction set your favorite high level language compiler translate your source code from. 

The fact is it was one of the most difficult and intriging elective courses, Mainframe Assemble, offer challenge me a novice inexperience computer science major. Today, I think most software developers or engineer would prefer C#, Java, NodeJS, Javascript, HTML, C++ and others. But here, it's another example of self motivation or my love/hate relationship with coding.

Fun fact: A previous job title I had was 'Component Assembler Builder' and there was no assembly code.
